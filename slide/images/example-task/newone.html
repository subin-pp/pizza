            <h2>DODGE CHALLENGER</h2>
            <p>While rival muscle cars have pivoted recently toward sharp handling, the 2023 Dodge Challenger keeps things retro with a package that’s designed more for old-school pony-car jollies and straight-line speed. A V-6 engine is standard in these non-SRT Challengers but the real fun comes with the optional naturally aspirated Hemi V-8 engines, which are offered in a variety of displacements and outputs spanning a 375-hp, 5.7-liter to a 485-hp, 6.4-liter. If you want even more power, Dodge will be happy to oblige with the big-stomper Challenger SRT Hellcat, which we review separately. The regular Challenger isn’t as intense as the outrageous Hellcat, but for some its V-8 burble and relatively comfortable ride will be enough to trigger nostalgic feelings for the vintage Dodge pony cars with which it shares a name. Enthusiast drivers will find modern versions of the Chevrolet Camaro and the Ford Mustang more capable on twisty roads and racetracks, but the Challenger’s old-school charm is undeniable.</p>

            <h2>PAGANI</h2>
            <p>With its shapely fenders and sprawling rear wing, the Huayra looks like it was built to conquer the racetrack. And much like a race car, it's constructed with an eye on minimizing curb weight. It's made from materials such as carbon-titanium HP62, a substance that's lighter and stronger than standard carbon fiber. The current Huayra is scheduled to be the last of the line. Still, that may change, since Pagani has a history of acquiescing to the requests of private collectors seeking a one-off or limited-edition model. With only 40 production models planned, the Huayra is rare and magnificent.</p>  </div>

            <h2>MCLERAN P1</h2>
            <p>McLaren Automotive replaced McLaren Cars in 2010. McLaren Cars had been founded in 1985 and released the McLaren F1 in 1992. Between 1994 and 2010, McLaren Cars was registered as a 'dormant company', before the founding of McLaren Automotive in 2010. The new company was originally separate from the existing McLaren companies to enable investment in the new venture, but was brought together in July 2017 after Ron Dennis sold his shares in McLaren Automotive and McLaren Group.</p>
